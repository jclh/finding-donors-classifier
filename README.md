This project is part of a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) program: [Data Science degree, Project 1](https://github.com/udacity/DSND_Term1).

I use several classification algorithms included in the **scikit-learn** package to model person-level income — using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census — and predict whether an individual makes more than \$50,000 per year. 

First, I obtain preliminary results from a small set of algorithms. Second, I choose the best candidate algorithm and further optimize it to improve performance.

Main files in the repository:

- `census.csv`: 1994 U.S. Census data; 14 features for 45,222 individuals. Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)). More details [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

- `find_donors-sklearn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook including main Python code.

- `visuals.py`: Plotting functions.


## Economic or Business question

The goal of the project is to build a tool that predicts whether an individual makes more than \$50,000 per year. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations and have limited resources for fund-raising. Estimating people's income can help the non-profit make their fund-raising more cost-effective; for example, deciding whether to reach out at all to a potential donor.


## Data Science motivation

In this project I use several supervised algorithms included in the scikit-learn package to model person-level income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. First, I obtain preliminary results from a set of algorithms. Second, I choose the best candidate algorithm and further optimize it to best model the data.


## Usage Example

The Jupyter Project highly recommends new users to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/); since it conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

1. Download Anaconda.

2. Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

3. To run the notebook:

```
jupyter notebook find_donors-sklearn.ipynb
```

## Python version

3.7.1 (default, Oct 23 2018, 14:07:42) 


## Python libraries

The Jupyter Notebook file, `find_donors-sklearn.ipynb`, requires the following Python libraries:

- IPython
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- sys
- time
- warnings
